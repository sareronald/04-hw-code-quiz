// Homework Task 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz //

## User Story
The purpose of this project was to create a timer-based JavaScript Coding Quiz. The application has a few Multiple Choice questions for the user to complete. It stores high scores on the user's device. The number of questions decides the length of time for the quiz (15seconds/question). To begin the user must click on the "Start" button and then choose the correct answer for each of the Multiple Choice questions. The user will be alerted when that get an answer right or wrong and the timer will be penalised if they answer the question incorrectly. The final score is based on how many questions the user chose correctly.  

## Acceptance Criteria
